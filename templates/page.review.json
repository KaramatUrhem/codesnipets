But I fell in love with the Ratna Necklace; I absolutely adored it. I bought it and placed an order for a matching set of earrings. I wanted Jhumkas specifically. They made the earrings and sent them to me; they were absolutely beautiful! They really know their craft. The Jhumkas look so stunning, gorgeous, and magnificent‚ÄîI don't know what to say, but it's one of my favorite sets. I've worn it a couple of times since I got it, and I've got so many compliments!

I fell in love with a pair of diamond danglers, a style that I had been looking for, and the price seemed reasonable as well. I was very apprehensive about ordering something online from India since I am in the US, but I still took a chance and placed an order. It was very impressive that Aurus quoted me a price including taxes etc. upfront, so there were no hidden fees. I have also reached out to several big jewelry companies in India, and none of them have been as easy to deal with or as responsive as Aurus. My order was on my doorstep within the time promised, and the process was seamless, to say the least. I am already a repeat customer since I have just ordered another unique piece from them and will be glad to pass these heirloom pieces on to my daughter. Thank you for a wonderful experience, Aurus!<\/p>",
